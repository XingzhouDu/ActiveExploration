Active exploration and reconstruction of vascular networks using microrobot swarms demands the cooperation between magnetic actuation platform, imaging devices and microrobot swarms. Here we provide a simple demonstration showing the functions of decision making, data recording and reconstruction process using recorded top-view and side-view videos. 

Run the demonstration by opening the "Demo from sample video.vi", running the vi and pressing the "Start" button. The program makes decisions at branch points and records data for reconstruction. The results are stored in "sample results" in csv format, which can be saved as xlsx format for further reconstruction. The reconstruction result can be acquired through running "Reconstruction\Reconstruction.m". The password for entering the edit mode is available from the author on request.
