# Active Exploration and Reconstruction

This repository is related to an unpublished manuscript.

Active exploration and reconstruction of vascular networks using microrobot swarms demands the cooperation between magnetic actuation platform, imaging devices and microrobot swarms. Here we provide a simple demonstration that can run on a Windows-based system showing the procedures of decision making, data recording and reconstruction process using recorded top-view and side-view videos. The source code for active exploration and reconstruction are provded for code review as well. More complicated demonstrations demand magnetic actuation of the microrobot swarms and decision-making based on the imaging feedback in real-time. 

## System Requirement
For running the demonstrations:
 - Windows 10
 - MATLAB R2020b
 - LabView 2019 (version 19.0f2 32-bit)
     - module

For reproducing the experimental results of active exploration using microrobot swarms:
 - Windows 10
 - MATLAB R2020b
 - LabView 2019 (version 19.0f2 32-bit)
     - module
